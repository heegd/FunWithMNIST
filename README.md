# FunWithMNIST

[MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is a database of handwritten digits that can be used to experiment with machine learning algorithms.


This project is a collection of different machine learning algorithm implementations with MNIST.  The examples are kept short and consistent so that they can be used as a quick reference.
