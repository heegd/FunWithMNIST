    "## Create the Model\n",
    "A neural network is like logistic regression in the sense that first a linear function is calculated and then it is run through an activiation function.  However, in a neural network, this linear/activation is chained together multiple times, with the result of the previous activation function feeding into the next linear function.  Each linear/activation pair is a layer in the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the linear and activtion functions are as follows:  \n",
    "A linear function is first calculated.  \n",
    "**z = xw + b**  \n",
    "Where **w** is a tensor of weights, **x** is a tensor of features, and **b** is a tensor of biases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the output of the linear function is run through an activation function.  \n",
    "**a = g(z)**  \n",
    "Where **g()** is the activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this simple example we are assuming the ReLU activation function for the activation function of the inner layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All we have to chain tensors together that perform these two calculations for as many layers as the user wants.  The user should also be able to specify how many outputs each layer has.  We will do this by letting them specify a list of layer sizes, where the index of the list corresponds to the layer of the network, and the value at that index corresponds to the number of outputs in that layer."
